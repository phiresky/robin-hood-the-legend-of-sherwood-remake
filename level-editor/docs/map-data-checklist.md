# Map data: editor → game

The goal is **new maps that play well**, assembled from reusable assets and editor
terrain. Existing maps are regression examples, not templates whose original
records must be reproduced. Export reads only the editor document and asset-local
definitions. One-time extraction may restore missing definitions into assets.
Connections and runtime indices are rebuilt after placement, rotation and copying.

**Full parity is not yet verified.** “Tested” below describes specific evidence,
not certification of every library asset or gameplay case. Best-effort exports
warn about omissions and preserve initial states where possible; warnings are
not evidence that an omitted feature works.

Latest validation (2026-10-05): 745 editor tests passed, two skipped; the game
build and native stair/control checks passed. Wychford loads with its spline wall
and passes control apply/reset. The terrain-junction correction passes the
synthetic four-triangle fan, all 48 crossings in the reduced Wychford case, and
182 movement tests (five skipped). The updated game build passes. The full
Wychford receiving-seam audit passes 17,468 directed actor crossings over 8,734
eligible pairs. This samples initial-state routes; it does not verify every
possible route, control state or feature category.

A fresh all-map batch exposed stale Lincoln spire appearance bindings, now
repaired and published. Native baseline construction and all eleven control
apply/reset checks pass. Moving the hall/spire leaves unresolved neighboring
receivers. The refreshed ten-map descriptor batch passes native construction
and apply/reset for all 71 compiled controls, but retains omissions. Five Lincoln
props lack gameplay definitions. The separate calibrated Wychford export also
passes native construction and all three control apply/reset checks, retaining
the church-traversal height mismatch and, before the woodland-bank fix below,
five physical-receiver binding omissions.
The calibrated descriptor has 146 movement areas, 21,323 sight obstacles and
17 masks. An earlier calibrated Wychford browser ZIP passes native mod discovery, image decoding and construction
without a base datadir, including its editable scene and appearance resources.
This remains short of full feature coverage or rendered actor/state parity.

The west-tower reveal now has a published terrain receiver probe. Derby's
compiled geometry is unchanged; Wychford gains its third control and two masks,
with native construction and apply/reset verified. Its elevated entrance and
the church traversal remain unresolved. The latest baked Wychford ZIP predates
this attachment change.

The woodland bank now publishes a bounded terrain attachment. Leicester's compiled
geometry is unchanged; both Wychford copies bind, with 74 sampled actor crossings
across 37 affected receiver pairs passing. Twelve new placements bind and four
out-of-reach cases reject. Three physical-receiver omissions remain: the footbridge,
edge bank and watermill. The latest baked ZIP predates this change too.

The east-village footbridge has a modeled sloping deck but no asset-owned walkable
surface. A staged deck definition passes native construction but creates an
independent navigation layer with no sampled receiver crossings. It remains
unpublished pending endpoint connections and navigation-ownership corrections.

Assets can author a placement ground height for new drops. The church-side
tower now uses its lower stair approach, verified at three elevations and four
rotations. Existing placements and Leicester's compiled geometry are unchanged;
this does not repair Wychford's already-elevated approach automatically.

| Map information | How the editor constructs it | Current evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|
| Background and minimap | Render placed models and textures, then downsample. | Browser bake and native ZIP decoding tested. |
| Character occlusion | Bake 16-bit depth from geometry, including paired appearance states. | Static/changing GPU fixtures pass; complete scene compositing remains open. |
| View/projectile masks and masking boundaries | Transform and rasterize local coverage; rebuild receiver, obstacle and state links. | Compiler/native state fixtures pass. Library coverage and complete visual integration remain incomplete. Depth alone does not replace these masks. |
| Walkable regions and layers | Transform surfaces and heights; join matching boundaries, coplanar surfaces and authored multi-plane regions. | Synthetic joins and sampled map routes pass; complete connectivity/traversal remains open. |
| Movement collision and openings | Intersect placed solids/contours with receiving planes; apply asset-owned clearances. | Compiler/runtime fixtures pass. Recovered geometry still needs review. |
| Spline walls | Measure pinned source meshes and deform local surfaces, collision, material contours, lighting, mask coverage and spatial sound emitters with source rotation, trimming, straightening and path placement. | Geometry comparisons pass 24 combinations; Wychford native loading/state checks pass. Material ownership passes moved/repeated, turned, sloped, corner and fractional-origin compiler checks; native ground/obstacle queries pass for three repeated sections. Explicit point/segment probes pass repeated, rising and curved compiler checks and native-fixture equality; native ambience queries pass. Disconnected lighting probes survive clipping independently and match the native ambience fixture. Automatic curved/rising lighting binds from source surfaces and passes native elevated-layer shadow queries. Spatial sound placement and acoustic settings pass native construction. Broader receiver-material, playback and traversal checks remain open. Repeated masks pass native bitmap, character/projectile boundary, altitude and obstacle-isolation checks; curved/cropped coverage passes editor tests. Longitudinal mask probes preserve bends and reject missing or competing receiving layers. A surviving explicit probe also preserves masks whose point anchor was trimmed. Disconnected receiving probes survive trimming without artificial connections and match the native mask fixture. Point-only cropped mask anchors and disconnected application boundaries remain unsupported, as do stateful sources, global sounds and disconnected sound crops; these emit warnings. |
| Navigation graph and fast-find grid | Build fresh graph/spatial structures from compiled geometry. | Native initial/switch-state route checks pass; no source grid or graph bytes are copied. Full actor coverage remains open. |
| Sight/physical obstacles | Transform local shapes, heights and physical/opaque flags. | Native initialization, apply and reset tested; asset ownership coverage remains incomplete. |
| Projection/elevation receivers | Derive height planes and crossing boundaries from placed receiving surfaces. | Fractional seams, slopes, copies and sampled actor crossings tested; complete placement coverage remains open. |
| Doors, gates and locks | Transform endpoints; resolve current neighbours and local initial/alternate permissions. | Compiler/runtime fixtures pass; incomplete assets still warn. |
| Building interiors | Connect entrances in each asset-local room automatically; use editor links or passage sockets between assets. | Separate, joined, moved, rotated and copied assemblies and editable ZIP round trips tested. |
| Stairs, ladders and climbable walls | Assemble local traversal surfaces/sockets and endpoints; derive independent layers and receiving approaches. | Changing stair barriers pass native rotation/copy checks; complete-animation climbing passes 2,166 directed routes. Changing ladder/wall barriers pass 84 actor/state checks covering four rotations, both wall-top door types and a barrier near the entrance, plus native collision/pathfinder checks. Independent copied controls pass 48 further checks; closing a barrier during climbing passes 24 directed checks. Broader placements, reopening during an existing movement sequence and rendered traversal remain open. |
| Jump zones and paired edges | Derive from marked surfaces or transform authored edges; find current destinations and trim blocked approaches/flights. | Moved/cross-asset destinations, skills and nearby state changes tested; broader authoring/traversal coverage remains open. |
| Surface materials | Transform local material regions and rebuild ground/obstacle/receiver links. | Compiler/native lookup fixtures and published definitions exist; complete geometry coverage remains open. |
| Lighting and shadow regions | Transform local contours and bind to current receiving planes/layers. | Published definitions and focused native queries tested; complete placement/query coverage remains open. |
| Environmental sounds | Transform local emitters; preserve timing, falloff, acoustic altitude and ambience filters. | Native construction tested across exported maps; audible playback and ownership review remain open. |
| Animated scenery | Transform local billboard anchors/boundaries; package pinned profiles and frames. | Authoring, publication, previews, normal native preload and ZIP construction tested. Six-frame GPU fixture passes Vulkan/OpenGL; scene ordering, fog, masks and shadows remain open. |
| Interactive state changes | Compile local initial/applied collision, sight, masks, appearance and door permissions into fresh control bindings. | Native apply/reset and paired bake fixtures pass. Complete asset/visual coverage remains open. Best-effort mode retains excess controls' initial states at the 16-switch-per-area runtime limit. |
| Map settings | Use editor identity/bounds and asset-owned forest/material defaults. | Compiler/runtime tests pass; ambience selection remains mission-owned. |
| Resource banks and references | Package baked images and pinned asset resources; resolve shared installed resources. | Independent scenery ZIP loading tested. Unpinned sprite/audio references still require the base installation. |
| Reopenable editor document | Include the original editable level JSON and pinned asset references in the ZIP. | Save/reopen/export regressions pass. |

Mission content remains separate from reusable map definitions:

| Mission information | Current construction / status |
|---|---|
| Player starts | Explicit Mission-tab entries export as `spawn_points`; resolve current terrain, sector/layer and receiver. No implicit PC is added to an empty map. |
| NPC soldiers | Explicit entries export as `soldiers`, retaining type, facing and allegiance and resolving placement against compiled geometry. |
| Imported missions | Explicit import restores available PC slots and soldiers with warnings. Preview population is not silently exported. |
| Scripts, patrols, inventory, objectives and other actors | Not provided by the minimal mission editor; outside map-only compilation parity. |

Detailed results, reproduction commands and historical diagnostics are in
[map compilation evidence](map-compilation-evidence.md) and
[testing instructions](../../docs/TESTING.md). Recovered record counts measure
asset-authoring progress; they are not a compiler acceptance criterion.
